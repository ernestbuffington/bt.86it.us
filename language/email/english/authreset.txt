Subject: {SUB_JECT}

Hi {GR_NAME},

We inform you that User {GRANTER} has decided to Reset ALL your Torrent Download authorisations for the Torrents they are sharing.

Your Old Download Permissions have now been Restored.  You will be still able to Download the Torrents you were authorised for,
but NOT those for which you weren't authorised.

In order to Download Torrents you never asked for authorisation to, you'll have to Send a New Request.

Remember that the Torrent Owner may change your Authorisations at any time.

You'll be sent a Confirmation Message in the Event of any Authorisation change for this and for any Torrent you Requested to Download.

Regards,


{EMAIL_SIG}
